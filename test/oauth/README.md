HotCRP OAuth test server
========================

This server, built using https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-server and
https://github.com/Nyholm/psr7, can be used to test HotCRP’s OAuth support.


Usage
-----

1. Install required libraries with `composer install`

2. Configure the server for your HotCRP installation. This involves choosing
   a `redirect_uri`, which is the full URI for the `oauth` page on the HotCRP
   installation you want to test. Enter this URI in `db.json`’s `clients`.
   The default is `http://localhost:8080/testconf/oauth`

3. Run the server with `php -S localhost:19382 oauth-provider.php`

4. Configure HotCRP to access the server by setting `$Opt["oAuthProviders"]`
   in `conf/options.php`:

	```php
	$Opt["oAuthProviders"][] = [
		"name" => "local",
		"client_id" => "hotcrp-oauth-test",
		"client_secret" => "Dudfield",
		"auth_uri" => "http://localhost:19382/auth",
		"token_uri" => "http://localhost:19382/token",
		"redirect_uri" => "http://localhost:8080/testconf/oauth",
		"button_html" => "Sign in with local OAuth"
	];
	```

	The `redirect_uri` here must equal the `redirect_uri` you configured in
	step 2.
